                <p class="project-paragraph">
                    Dice and Destiny is a web app centered around tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs), such as 
                    Dungeons & Dragons or Pathfinder. This project aims to provide both game masters and players 
                    with a one-stop shop for anything they may need for their games. Need a random non-player 
                    character name (NPC)? Use the name generator. Do you a ideas for quests to fill out an 
                    adventuring guild mission board? The random quest generator has you covered. Did you choose a 
                    green Dragonborn as your race? You can use our player character racial flavor enhancer to get 
                    ideas to make your Dragonborn wizard more customized to you with green fireballs, as well as 
                    give off a poisonous fume. This and more at Dice and Destiny.

                <h1 class="project-header">What did I learn?</h1>
                <p class="project-paragraph">
                    Dice and Destiny was my first project coding in Dart with Flutter. I learned quite a lot about 
                    the Flutter framework and the Dart language. I also learned a lot about APIs, random generation, 
                    and prototype software. I used the Firebase API to handle user accounts. I added Firebase to 
                    mainly learn about APIs and user account management. I didnâ€™t get far with this as other aspects 
                    of the project took over my focus. I learn a bunch about random generation. I ended up coding all 
                    of the generation lists myself. This took a lot of my time and wasn't the most effective way to 
                    code this. By the end of the project, I think I ended up with one of the random generation files 
                    having about 1300 lines of code and 90% of it being just lists. To get an idea of what I wanted 
                    Dice and Destiny to look like I spent a lot of time working in Figma to build a nice digital 
                    prototype. This helped me keep the final UI of the project clean and well organized.

                <h1 class="project-header">What would I do differently?</h1>
                <p class="project-paragraph-end">
                    There is a lot I would do differently with this project. The good news is this project is on my 
                    work-in-progress list. I didn't get as much done with this project as I wanted to as I only had 
                    4 weeks to work on it. I am proud of how far I go but it is still very rough around the edges. 
                    The first thing I would do differently is either find a TTRPG database or API to handle the items 
                    list for the random generation or build on myself. This aspect of the project took a lot of time 
                    and ended up taking time away from the player side of the project. Secondly, I would use a 
                    different language and framework. Flutter and Dart are amazing with mobile applications but 
                    slightly limited on the customization of the web app side of things. I think a project like this 
                    built-in HTML and CSS would be a lot cleaner and easier to host on GitHub pages or a site like 
                    that. Thirdly, I would make sure I would focus on the scalability of this project. I have big 
                    plans for this application and in the first iteration, I got overwhelmed and had to scrap a lot 
                    of the features and ended up having to leave a lot of the player features behind.
