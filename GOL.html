                This project is John Conway’s Game of Life. This was the first semi-solo project I did while in 
                school. Our class was tasked with making a program that displayed John Conway’s mathematical 
                cellular automation. This had to follow the strict rules of how each cell survived and reproduced.<br>

                    •   Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives, unchanged, to the next generation.<br>
                    •   Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors comes to life.<br>

                What did I learn?
            </h1>
            <p class="project-paragraph">
                This project was the first semi-solo project in my computer science program. We were given a 
                pre-built Windows form and some pre-built code. We were tasked with handling a majority of the 
                back-end and a few front-end items such as buttons and setting menus. I learned a lot about 
                version control, user interface, back-end setting saving, and much more. For the version control, 
                we used Git to learn the basics of being able to revert code if needed if; large-scale errors 
                arise. With user interface I learned to make sure buttons are clearly labeled, menus are clear in 
                what they do, and the application as a whole is easy to navigate. This also leads to making sure 
                user settings are saved and displayed properly across the app from things like background colors 
                to cell dimensions to being able to save and record the cell grid to a txt file.
            </p>
            <h1 class="project-header">What would I do differently?</h1>
            <p class="project-paragraph-end">
                If I was to do this project over again I would make changes mainly to the UI. I feel like at the 
                time I didn't focus enough on this and if I were to give this project to a random person they 
                would have a hard time understanding how to navigate the application. I note the play, pause, and 
                next buttons. I used the icon maker that comes installed with Windows Form to make fully custom 
                icons for these buttons but didn't take into account the size being too small. As I have gone 
                through my program I have learned a lot about front-end and how to make things naturally intuitive 
                for the user to navigate the application.
