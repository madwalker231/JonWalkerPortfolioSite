                <p class="project-paragraph">
                    Knowledge Ninja was my first group project at Full Sail. We were placed into teams and told to 
                    come up with an idea for an app. With technology increasingly becoming a part of not only 
                    adults' daily lives but also children's lives, There are many options out there to help filter 
                    what your child can see, but there is little in the ways of helping them learn, this is where 
                    Knowledge Ninja comes in. Knowledge Ninja aims to provide your child with a safe, interesting, 
                    and ad-free learning experience. The flagship feature is to use gamification to help your child 
                    learn. Using simple games like memory card matching, drag-and-drop puzzles, and so much more we 
                    hope to help your child explore the world around them.

                        IDE: Andriod Studios

                <h1 class="project-header"> What did I learn?</h1>
                <p class="project-paragraph">
                    This project was my first group project. I learned a lot about version control and 
                    communication when working with a group on a project like this. We ran into issues with GitHub 
                    when it came to everyone trying to push code to the repository and merge code. Communication 
                    was another big issue with our team. There was no clear-cut image of what we wanted the app to 
                    do and how we wanted it to look. This resulted in everyone taking different paths on UI and 
                    functionality. I also learned a lot about mobile development and UI elements. Getting the UI 
                    right on a mobile platform can be difficult as there isn't much space. Learning about padding 
                    and how to lay out UI elements properly was a big part of the learning curve.

                <h1 class="project-header">What would I do differently?</h1>
                <p class="project-paragraph-end">
                    If I was to create this project again there is a lot I would do differently. First, I would make 
                    sure everyone working on the project had a clear vision of what the app was supposed to look 
                    like. I would do this with prototype software like Figma or Sketch. Secondly, I would make sure 
                    the whole team understands how to properly push and pull code from GitHub or GitLab to make sure 
                    there are no issues with bottlenecking merging code bases and to make sure the code base doesn't 
                    require any rebasing. Thirdly, I would make sure to pay close attention to the UI to make it 
                    easier for kids to navigate. The whole idea of this app was based on learning for kids and going 
                    back and revisiting the UI, we did not design the UI with kids in mind.
