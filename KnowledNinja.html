                Knowledge Ninja was my first group project at Full Sail. We were placed into teams and told to 
                come up with an idea for an app. With technology increasingly becoming a part of not only 
                adults' daily lives but also children's lives, There are many options out there to help filter 
                what your child can see, but there is little in the ways of helping them learn, this is where 
                Knowledge Ninja comes in. Knowledge Ninja aims to provide your child with a safe, interesting, 
                and ad-free learning experience. The flagship feature is to use gamification to help your child 
                learn. Using simple games like memory card matching, drag-and-drop puzzles, and so much more we 
                hope to help your child explore the world around them.
