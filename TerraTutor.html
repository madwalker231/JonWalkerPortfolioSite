                    Terra Tutor is my capstone project. This mobile app aims to provide users with all the 
                    information they need to be the best gardener they can. Giving new gardeners the information 
                    they need on which plants are more difficult or easier to take care of, finding plants they want 
                    through an extensive plant database, and helping them understand their plant's needs. Terra 
                    Tutor also aims to give more experienced gardeners a place to find new plants, look up 
                    information about their favorite plants, and manage their gardens. Using databases to track 
                    user settings and preferences your gardening experience will be as customized to you as your 
                    backyard garden. Terra Tutor is more than just an encyclopedia about plants. We offer watering 
                    reminders, weather updates, and so much more to help keep your plants happy and healthy. So come 
                    to Terra Tutor where you will learn to grow with your plants.

                <h1 class="project-header">What did I learn?</h1>
                <p class="project-paragraph">
                    There was a lot that I learned with this project. With this being my capstone project I was 
                    assigned a group. There were only 3 of us, and communication was a huge part of this project. I 
                    learned the importance of following a design document and a prototype. This helped immensely 
                    with solving any confusion one team member may have and keeping everyone on track on which 
                    technology stack is being used. I also learned a lot about GitHub. Creating pull requests and 
                    the importance of thoroughly testing your code in your branch before requesting your code be 
                    merged with the main branch. There were moments when code wasn't tested properly and big issues 
                    were found after the branch was merged. Finally, I learned a lot about UI and to keep an open 
                    mind about a UI element that someone brings to the table, and even if I don't like it to leave 
                    it up to the user to test if it seems like a good element or not. All things considered, this 
                    is just the tip of the iceberg of what I learned about working on this project. I truly feel 
                    like my technical skills were tested and honed with this project. I got to go deeper into APIs. 
                    We used Firebase for your user database tracking, and because we wanted to let the users have 
                    as much customization as possible we had to set rules in our user database that allowed the 
                    user to read and write to the database. We also got to use Open Weather Map to handle our 
                    weather alerts. Getting to understand what information to pull through and how to get the calls 
                    was challenging but a fun puzzle to crack.

                <h1 class="project-header">What would I do differently?</h1>
                <p class="project-paragraph-end">
                    There isn't much I would change about this project. Using Flutter and Dart made getting the UI 
                    squared away and implemented easy and for the most part, I feel like our group got pretty far 
                    into our initial idea for this app. I would however change how things were implemented. We would 
                    run into the issue of rework a lot. An example of this is when I was working on the weather API 
                    functionality. The widget tiles were made but we didn't account for the spacing of the text when 
                    the update was displayed in the UI tile. This caused us to have to rework the UI tile sizes. There 
                    were other issues like this that we ran into along the way. I would change how we went about 
                    building the features and testing our to make sure the implementation is correct and to eliminate 
                    as much rework as we can. I would have also liked to implement higher-level technology. We had 
                    planned to use Riverpods to handle caching reactivation. We weren't able to implement this as we 
                    started to get too far down the development plan that going back and implementing the Riverpods 
                    would cause a lot of code rework.
